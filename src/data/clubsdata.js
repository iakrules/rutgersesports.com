We’re here to promote equality in gaming and provide a safe and quality environment for gamers of all kinds while uplifting women. We hope to provide the women of Rutgers a comfortable place to express their passion for gaming who are seeking a community where they feel they belong. We value creating a club where everyone feels like they have a space and have people to share their hobbies with, and support all genders in participating in competitive and non competitive gaming. If you’re looking for like-minded friends or just a place to hang out, come check us out! We also hold events and tournaments throughout the semester, be on the lookout for those!"
